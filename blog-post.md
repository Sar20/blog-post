# Today, we learned how to code using Markdown

We _really_ enjoyed practicing Markdown in StackEdit. Here are a few things we learned:
* Use ** around text to make it **bold**
* Use _ around text to make it _italic_

We then used [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to learn even more Markdown syntax.

According to Daring Fireball:
>Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the > before the first line of a hand-wrapped paragraph.

We think you should learn Markdown too!
